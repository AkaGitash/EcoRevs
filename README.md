# The Issue at Hand
## Global Waste Management
Waste management is a very serious issue across the world. In simple terms, only specific materials can be recycled, and when other objects are mixed in, the entire batch has to be thrown into the garbage. Whenever citizens don’t recycle properly or dispose of waste improperly, waste management is a harder process. Instead of sorting through the waste, it is simply dumped into landfills or oceans, or is incinerated. If everyday citizens were to recycle items correctly, it would make a huge positive impact on the world.

## Carbon Emissions
Due to ineffective waste management methods, carbon emissions increase. When items that are supposed to be recycled are also thrown into waste, the level of toxins, such as dioxins, released increases by tons. This increases air pollution, contributes to acid rain, and harms the environment.

## Resources 
When materials are recycled, much fewer resources are required to recreate the same product. This increases efficiency, decreases release of toxins, decreases need to acquire resources from the environment, and provides a “greener” way to create products. However, due to ineffective waste management, a lot of recyclable items are incinerated or disposed of as waste. This increases the carbon footprint of each individual by tons.
