# The Issue at Hand
## Global Waste Management
Waste management is a very serious issue across the world. In simple terms, only specific materials can be recycled, and when other objects are mixed in, the entire batch has to be thrown into the garbage. Whenever citizens don’t recycle properly or dispose of waste improperly, waste management is a harder process. Instead of sorting through the waste, it is simply dumped into landfills or oceans, or is incinerated. If everyday citizens were to recycle items correctly, it would make a huge positive impact on the world.

## Carbon Emissions
Due to ineffective waste management methods, carbon emissions increase. When items that are supposed to be recycled are also thrown into waste, the level of toxins, such as dioxins, released increases by tons. This increases air pollution, contributes to acid rain, and harms the environment.

## Resources 
When materials are recycled, much fewer resources are required to recreate the same product. This increases efficiency, decreases release of toxins, decreases need to acquire resources from the environment, and provides a “greener” way to create products. However, due to ineffective waste management, a lot of recyclable items are incinerated or disposed of as waste. This increases the carbon footprint of each individual by tons.

# The Importance of the Product
## Why is this Product Important?
To tackle the aforementioned issues, EcoRevs was developed. This product sorts through waste items one by one as they are thrown, determines whether they are recyclable, compostable, or simply garbage. It automatically sorts trash and  throws it in a specific bin. This will reduce carbon emissions by millions of tons if applied properly, and reduce environment harm. This product is necessary to improve waste management because no matter how many guides or brochures are given, people get caught up and forget to take time to dispose of items correctly. By applying this software to a simple bot in a large trashcan, it can automatically sort the items into the required bins. This minimizes the efforts required by the user, and maximizes effective waste management. In short, this product is the necessary bridge between pure laziness and a clean world.
