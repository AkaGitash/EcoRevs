# The Issue at Hand
## Global Waste Management
Waste management is a very serious issue across the world. In simple terms, only specific materials can be recycled, and when other objects are mixed in, the entire batch has to be thrown into the garbage. Whenever citizens don’t recycle properly or dispose of waste improperly, waste management is a harder process. Instead of sorting through the waste, it is simply dumped into landfills or oceans, or is incinerated. If everyday citizens were to recycle items correctly, it would make a huge positive impact on the world.

## Carbon Emissions
Due to ineffective waste management methods, carbon emissions increase. When items that are supposed to be recycled are also thrown into waste, the level of toxins, such as dioxins, released increases by tons. This increases air pollution, contributes to acid rain, and harms the environment.

## Resources 
When materials are recycled, much fewer resources are required to recreate the same product. This increases efficiency, decreases release of toxins, decreases need to acquire resources from the environment, and provides a “greener” way to create products. However, due to ineffective waste management, a lot of recyclable items are incinerated or disposed of as waste. This increases the carbon footprint of each individual by tons.

# The Importance of the Product
## Why is this Product Important?
To tackle the aforementioned issues, EcoRevs was developed. This product sorts through waste items one by one as they are thrown, determines whether they are recyclable, compostable, or simply garbage. It automatically sorts trash and  throws it in a specific bin. This will reduce carbon emissions by millions of tons if applied properly, and reduce environment harm. This product is necessary to improve waste management because no matter how many guides or brochures are given, people get caught up and forget to take time to dispose of items correctly. By applying this software to a simple bot in a large trashcan, it can automatically sort the items into the required bins. This minimizes the efforts required by the user, and maximizes effective waste management. In short, this product is the necessary bridge between pure laziness and a clean world.

## How is it different from other Products?
There are several other products out in the market which are working towards the same goal. However, they are ineffective due to the fact that they are applied to large waste management and recycling plants. Most of this work is done through labor workers at plants, but with the introduction of machine learning, large machines and software have been used to sort through recycling. The key difference between these sorting methods and EcoRevs is the fact that our bin can be applied to smaller locations. It tackles the root of the problem right away, when the item is disposed of, instead of when all the items are gathered. This makes the problem much easier to solve, and this AI system can easily be implemented using a camera, and a simple flap system within a disposal container.

# How to use EcoRevs monitoring application

Making an account is also as easy as signing in with your Google account! Simply sign in and you are able to track your bin's status and also customize the bin as per your needs, get rewarded with coupons of renowned brands for throwing your trash. The user experience is one that is clean and elegant, allowing it to be user-handy.

# Features
Our application hosts numerous features that the user can engage with.

# FEATURE	DESCRIPTION
## Firebase Authentication 
Using Firebase Authentication, we can easily let users sign in using their Google account. It is a simple way to get their name, email/username, and profile picture in the click of only a few buttons.

## Firebase Realtime Database 
The Firebase Realtime Database is responsible for storing the sub-bin status of each individual. They are all saved in a JSON format that is easily accessible by the Android Application.

## Firebase Storage 
The Firebase Storage is used to store images, such as uploaded pictures by the picam, These can later be accessed by the mobile application.

## Firebase realtime data fetch 
The data of ultrasonic sensor is sent to the firebase and is stored there, then with an GET request the data is fetched back and displayed on the mobile application in form of ellusive graphics, such as pie-charts stating the current bin status, if any one of the sub-bins is filled more than 80%, envac's central facility receives a notification, prompting waste transportation to commence.

## Customization of the bin 
With the help of mobile application, one can modify the bin as per their use cases, currently we've 4 ready-made models, Economy model, Corporate model, Hospital model, Railways model. The bin can also be custom made via the availabe settings to chnage each sub-bin as per user's need, these submission will be stored in our firebase db, and will be prompted to the ML model deployed on azure, which will chnage the current model.

## Credit System 
Our bin offers a reward system to attract users. When users deposit trash successfully, a Dynamic QR code is generated using UUIDs. Scanning this QR code adds reward points to their mobile app profile based on the type of waste. The points are determined by the current market value of recyclable items. Users can later redeem these credits as either coupons or cash. 
These coupons can be sponsored by: 

a. Local Businesses
Nearby restaurants, clothing shops, and other establishments in the vicinity of the bin can sponsor us. The mobile app will have a section for “Nearby Shops” to facilitate this. <br><br>
b. Prominent Companies: Similar to popular mobile payment applications like Paytm and Gpay, our system will consist of coupons sponsored by companies like Zomato, Domino's, Lenskart, etc. Which can be redeemed against these points

## Monthly track 
Using the Firebase Realtime Database one can access their old trash submission history, It's a simple way to get their monthly analytics of the ammount of trash thrown.

## Troubleshooting access 
If one individual faces any sort of trouble with the bin or the mobile application, he/she can submit the issue with single click, directing them to the issue submission page, where an ticket will be created, which will be looked at by our troubleshooting experts, and the solution will be made availabe as soon as possible, currently we're using github as our issue ticket mechanism, on larger ticket submissions we'll create our own server.
